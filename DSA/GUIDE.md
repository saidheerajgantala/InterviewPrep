# Learning Templates Index

- Algorithm reference template: see `Algorithms/ALGORITHM_REFERENCE.md`
- Problem walkthrough template: see `Problems/PROBLEM_WALKTHROUGH.md`

Use the reference when documenting an algorithm family. Use the walkthrough for a specific problem (brute force → optimize → correctness → tests).
