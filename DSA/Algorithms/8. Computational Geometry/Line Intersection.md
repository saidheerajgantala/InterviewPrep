# Line Intersection

## Name
- Category: Computational Geometry
- Summary: Algorithms for detecting and computing the intersection point(s) of line segments in a plane, including both the simple case of two segments and the more complex case of finding all intersections among multiple segments.

## Preconditions / Assumptions
- Lines are represented as segments with two endpoints (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
- Coordinates are real numbers (typically floating-point)
- For multiple line segments, they are provided as a collection or array
- Intersections occur only at points (not along overlapping segments, unless specified)
- Numerical precision is sufficient for accurate calculations

## Properties
- Deterministic
- Complete (finds all intersections)
- For two segments: O(1) time complexity
- For n segments: O(n log n + k log n) time complexity using sweep line (where k is the number of intersections)
- Handles special cases like parallel lines, overlapping segments, and edge intersections
- Can be extended to handle vertical segments and edge cases

## Complexity (per variant)
| Variant | Time | Space | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Two segments | O(1) | O(1) | Simple vector algebra |
| Brute force | O(nÂ²) | O(1) | Check all pairs |
| Sweep line | O(n log n + k log n) | O(n) | k = number of intersections |
| Bentley-Ottmann | O(n log n + k log n) | O(n) | More efficient implementation |
| Output-sensitive | O((n+k) log n) | O(n) | For reporting all intersections |

## When to Use / When to Avoid
- Use if:
  - Need to determine if two line segments intersect
  - Need to find the exact intersection point
  - Need to find all intersections among many segments
  - Geometric computations are required in 2D space
  - Precision is important
- Avoid if:
  - Approximate solutions are acceptable (simpler methods may suffice)
  - Dealing with 3D lines (requires different algorithms)
  - Numerical precision is a concern (consider robust geometric predicates)
  - Very large number of segments with many intersections (consider specialized algorithms)

## Correctness (Proof Sketch)
- For two segments:
  - Two line segments intersect if and only if:
    - Each segment straddles the line containing the other segment, or
    - The segments are collinear and overlap
  - This can be determined using the orientation test
  - The intersection point can be computed using parametric line equations
- For sweep line algorithm:
  - Correctness follows from the invariant that all intersections to the left of the sweep line have been found
  - Events are processed in left-to-right order
  - Only adjacent segments in the status structure can intersect
  - All potential intersections are detected and processed

## Implementation Notes
- Use robust geometric predicates to handle numerical precision issues
- Consider using integer arithmetic or exact arithmetic for critical applications
- Handle special cases like vertical lines, coincident endpoints, and overlapping segments
- For the sweep line algorithm, use a self-balancing binary search tree for the status structure
- Consider using a priority queue for the event queue
- Be careful with floating-point comparisons and use appropriate epsilon values
- For large datasets, consider spatial partitioning techniques
- Handle degeneracies like multiple segments intersecting at the same point
- Implement proper event ordering for the sweep line algorithm
- Consider using specialized geometric libraries for production code

## Edge-case Checklist
- Parallel lines: No intersection or coincident lines
- Vertical lines: Special handling for infinite slope
- Collinear segments: May overlap or share endpoints
- Segments sharing an endpoint: Count as intersection or not based on requirements
- Degenerate segments (points): Handle according to problem definition
- Multiple segments intersecting at the same point: Handle properly in sweep line
- Numerical precision issues: Use robust geometric predicates
- Empty input: Return empty result
- Single segment: No intersections

## Examples
- Two-segment intersection:
  - Segments: [(0, 0) to (10, 10)] and [(0, 10) to (10, 0)]
  - Orientation tests: o1 = 2, o2 = 1, o3 = 2, o4 = 1
  - Result: Segments intersect at (5, 5)
  
- Multiple segments:
  - Segments: [(0, 0) to (10, 10)], [(0, 10) to (10, 0)], [(5, 0) to (5, 10)]
  - Sweep line processes events from left to right
  - First intersection: (5, 5) between segments 1 and 2
  - Second intersection: (5, 5) between segments 1 and 3
  - Third intersection: (5, 5) between segments 2 and 3
  - Result: Three intersections at point (5, 5)

## Variants / Alternatives
- Bentley-Ottmann algorithm: Efficient implementation of sweep line
- DCEL (Doubly Connected Edge List): For handling planar subdivisions
