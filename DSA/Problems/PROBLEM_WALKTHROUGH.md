# üìù Problem Solving Template

## **Problem Statement**

* Clearly define the problem in simple words.
* Example input + expected output.
* Constraints if any.

---

## **Step 1: Thinking Process (Brute Force)**

* Write your raw thought process.
* What is the most *obvious* way to solve this?
* Break it down into mini steps.
* Don‚Äôt optimize yet.

---

## **Step 2: Flow Steps (Brute Force)**

* Numbered flow of brute force logic (like pseudocode but human-readable).

---

## **Step 3: Brute Force Implementation (Code)**

* Write a brute force version in code (Python for example).

---

## **Step 4: Complexity Analysis (Brute Force)**

* Time Complexity (Big-O).
* Space Complexity.
* Why it is inefficient.

---

## **Step 5: Visualizing Redundant Computation**

* Draw or explain overlapping/repeated work.
* Example: recursive calls expanding again & again.
* Show clearly what is repeated.

---

## **Why are we using this algorithm?**

* State the algorithm you will use.
* What property matches this problem (optimal substructure, monotonic predicate, greedy-choice property, DAG shortest path, etc.)?
* Why alternatives are weaker or violate constraints.
* Preconditions are satisfied (sorted data? non-negative weights? DAG?).

---

## **Algo optimization**

### **Step 1: Thinking Process (Optimized)**

* What changes when we optimize?
* How do we remove redundancy?

### **Step 2: Flow Steps (Optimized)**

* Step-by-step breakdown of optimized approach.

### **Step 3: Implementation (Optimized)**

* Optimized code.

### **Step 4: Complexity Analysis (Optimized)**

* Compare to brute force.

### **Step 5: Visualizing Computation (Optimized)**

* Show how redundancy is reduced.

*(Repeat until most optimal solution is reached.)*

### **Complexity Summary**

| Approach | Time | Space | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Brute Force | O(...) | O(...) |  |
| Optimized (Algorithm: <name>) | O(...) | O(...) |  |
