# System Design Learning Repository

This repository contains structured learning materials for system design concepts, patterns, and case studies. It follows a comprehensive roadmap from fundamentals to advanced topics.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections:

### üìö Patterns
All system design concepts, principles, and patterns are organized in a numbered sequence to provide a clear learning path:

- **001_Fundamentals**: Basic concepts of distributed systems
- **002_CoreComponents**: Essential building blocks like databases, caching, and messaging
- **003_DistributedSystems**: Consistency models, coordination, and fault tolerance
- **004_ArchitecturalPatterns**: Reusable design patterns for various aspects of system design
- **005_ResiliencePatterns**: Patterns for building fault-tolerant systems
- **006_ScalabilityPatterns**: Approaches to handle growth in users, traffic, and data
- **007_DatabasePatterns**: Patterns for data storage and retrieval
- **008_LoadBalancingPatterns**: Strategies for distributing workloads
- **009_MessagingPatterns**: Communication patterns between components
- **010_MicroservicesPatterns**: Patterns specific to microservice architectures
- **011_Performance**: Metrics and optimization techniques
- **012_Security**: Authentication, authorization, and data security
- **013_AdvancedTopics**: Machine learning systems, blockchain, and edge computing

### üìã Case Studies
Real-world system design examples organized by system type:

- **Web Applications**: URL shorteners, social media platforms, etc.
- **Data-Intensive Applications**: Recommendation systems, search engines, etc.
- **Infrastructure Services**: Distributed file systems, load balancers, etc.
- **Database Systems**: Distributed databases, time-series databases, etc.
- **Streaming Systems**: Video streaming, event streaming systems, etc.
- **Social Networks**: Instagram, Twitter, Facebook designs
- **E-Commerce Systems**: Online shopping platforms, payment systems, etc.
- **Messaging Systems**: Chat applications, notification systems, etc.

## Templates
- **SYSTEM_DESIGN_PATTERN.md**: Comprehensive template for documenting design patterns
- **CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md**: Detailed template for system design case studies

Both templates provide structured frameworks to ensure consistency and completeness in documentation.

## üó∫Ô∏è Getting Started
1. Begin with the **SYSTEM_DESIGN_ROADMAP.md** to understand the learning path
2. Study the fundamentals in the Patterns/001_Fundamentals directory
3. Move to core components and distributed systems concepts
4. Review architectural and specialized patterns
5. Apply your knowledge by studying and recreating the case studies

## üìù How to Use This Repository
- Use the templates to document your own patterns and case studies
- Follow the numbered sequence in the Patterns directory for a structured learning experience
- Refer to the README files in each directory for more specific guidance
- Use the INDEX.md file to quickly find specific topics
