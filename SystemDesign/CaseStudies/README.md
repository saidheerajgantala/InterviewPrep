# System Design Case Studies

This directory contains detailed case studies of real-world systems, organized by system type. Each case study follows the template defined in `CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md`.

## Case Study Categories

### Web Applications
Common web applications like URL shorteners, social media platforms, and e-commerce sites.

### Data-Intensive Applications
Systems that process and analyze large volumes of data, like recommendation engines and search engines.

### Infrastructure Services
Core infrastructure components like distributed file systems, load balancers, and rate limiters.

### Database Systems
Specialized database systems including distributed, time-series, and graph databases.

### Streaming Systems
Real-time data streaming systems for video, events, and analytics.

### Social Networks
Large-scale social networking platforms and their components.

### E-Commerce Systems
Online shopping platforms, payment systems, and inventory management.

### Messaging Systems
Communication systems including chat applications, notification systems, and email delivery.

## Using These Case Studies

Each case study provides:
- A comprehensive problem definition
- System scale and estimation calculations
- High-level and detailed component design
- Scalability, reliability, and security considerations
- Trade-offs and design decisions
- Lessons from real-world implementations

## How to Create a New Case Study

1. Copy the `CASE_STUDY_TEMPLATE.md` file
2. Rename it to reflect your system (e.g., `URL_Shortener.md`)
3. Place it in the appropriate category folder
4. Fill in each section with detailed information
5. Include diagrams where appropriate (ASCII or markdown-compatible)
6. Reference related patterns from the Patterns directory

## Learning Approach

For effective learning:
1. Start with simpler systems (URL shortener, rate limiter)
2. Progress to medium complexity (chat application, payment system)
3. Tackle complex systems (social networks, search engines)
4. Compare different approaches to similar problems
5. Identify common patterns across different system types

These case studies demonstrate how to apply the patterns and principles from the Patterns directory to real-world problems.
