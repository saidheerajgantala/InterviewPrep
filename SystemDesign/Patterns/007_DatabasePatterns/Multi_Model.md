## 1) TL;DR (Executive Summary)
- **Problem**: Applications need multiple data models (docs, graph, KV) and want fewer moving parts.
- **Solution (essence)**: Use a single database engine that supports multiple models behind one storage/transaction layer.
- **Use when**: Mixed workloads benefit from shared transactions/operations and operational simplicity.
- **Key tradeoff**: Feature breadth vs depth/performance of best-in-class single-model systems.

---

## 2) Models Supported
- Document (JSON/BSON), Key-Value, Graph (property graph), Column-family, Search indices.
- Shared query layer or per-model APIs; optional cross-model joins.

## 4) Properties & Tradeoffs
| Aspect | Pros | Cons | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ops | Fewer systems | Vendor lock-in | Simpler platform |
| Consistency | Shared TXs possible | Cross-model limits | Check isolation guarantees |
| Performance | Good enough | Not best-in-class | Benchmark critical paths |

---

## 5) Implementation Guide
- Start with primary access pattern; validate each modelâ€™s indexing.
- Avoid cross-model anti-patterns that degrade performance.
- Backup/restore and consistency across models must be tested.

---

## 6) Pitfalls & Edge Cases
- Hot documents/vertices; partitioning still required.
- Query planner surprises across models; use explicit indexes/hints.

---

## 7) Observability
- Metrics by model: QPS, latency, index hit rates, storage usage per model.
