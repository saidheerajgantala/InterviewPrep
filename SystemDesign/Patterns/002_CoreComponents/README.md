# 002: Core System Components

This directory covers the essential building blocks of modern distributed systems.

## Databases
- **Relational Databases**: Traditional SQL databases and their role in system design
- **NoSQL Databases**: Document, key-value, column, and graph databases
- **Data Replication & Consistency**: Strategies for replicating data across nodes
- **ACID vs BASE**: Different consistency models for database operations

## Caching
- **Application Caching**: In-memory caching strategies at the application level
- **Database Caching**: Query caching, result caching, and buffer pools
- **CDN**: Content delivery networks for caching static assets globally
- **Cache Invalidation Strategies**: Approaches to maintaining cache freshness

## Message Queues & Pub/Sub
- **Kafka**: Distributed event streaming platform
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker implementing AMQP
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Design patterns centered around event production and consumption
- **Stream Processing**: Real-time data processing frameworks and patterns

These core components form the backbone of most distributed systems. After understanding these components, proceed to Distributed Systems concepts.
