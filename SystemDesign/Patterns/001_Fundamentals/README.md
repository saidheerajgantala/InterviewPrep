# 001: System Design Fundamentals

This directory covers the foundational concepts of system design that serve as building blocks for more complex patterns and architectures.

## Basics
- **Client-Server Architecture**: The fundamental model of distributed computing
- **Network Protocols**: HTTP, TCP/IP, UDP and their roles in system design
- **REST API Design**: Principles and best practices for designing RESTful APIs
- **Storage Types**: Block, file, and object storage systems

## Scalability Concepts
- **Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling**: Different approaches to handling increased load
- **Load Balancing**: Techniques for distributing workloads across resources
- **Caching Strategies**: Methods to reduce latency and database load
- **Database Sharding & Partitioning**: Approaches to scaling databases

These fundamentals form the building blocks for understanding more complex system design concepts and patterns. Master these concepts before moving on to Core Components.
