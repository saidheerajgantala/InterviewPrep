# System Design Patterns and Concepts

This directory contains all system design concepts, principles, and patterns organized in a numbered sequence to provide a clear learning path. Each pattern follows the template defined in `SYSTEM_DESIGN_PATTERN.md`.

## Learning Path

### 001: Fundamentals
Basic concepts of distributed systems including client-server architecture, network protocols, and scalability concepts.

### 002: Core Components
Essential building blocks like databases, caching systems, and messaging queues.

### 003: Distributed Systems
Concepts related to building distributed systems, including consistency models, coordination, and fault tolerance.

### 004: Architectural Patterns
Fundamental structural organization schemas for software systems.

### 005: Resilience Patterns
Patterns for building fault-tolerant and self-healing systems.

### 006: Scalability Patterns
Approaches to handle growth in users, traffic, and data.

### 007: Database Patterns
Patterns related to data storage, retrieval, and management.

### 008: Load Balancing Patterns
Strategies for distributing workloads across multiple computing resources.

### 009: Messaging Patterns
Communication patterns between distributed system components.

### 010: Microservices Patterns
Design patterns specific to microservice architectures.

### 011: Performance
Metrics and optimization techniques for system performance.

### 012: Security
Authentication, authorization, and data security patterns.

### 013: Advanced Topics
Cutting-edge topics including machine learning systems, blockchain, and edge computing.

## Using These Patterns

Each pattern document includes:
- Context and problem description
- Solution characteristics and tradeoffs
- Implementation considerations
- Common pitfalls
- Real-world examples

When implementing a system, consider combining multiple patterns to address specific requirements and constraints.

## Learning Approach

1. Start with the fundamentals (001) to build a solid foundation
2. Progress through core components (002) and distributed systems (003)
3. Learn about various architectural and specialized patterns (004-010)
4. Study performance optimization and security (011-012)
5. Explore advanced topics (013) once you've mastered the basics

This numbered structure helps you follow a logical progression from basic to advanced concepts.
