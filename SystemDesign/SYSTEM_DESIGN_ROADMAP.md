## Practice Strategy
1. Start with small components (e.g., design a rate limiter)
2. Move to medium-sized systems (e.g., design a URL shortener)
3. Progress to complex systems (e.g., design Instagram)
4. Practice explaining your design decisions
5. Review real-world architectures and case studies
6. Participate in system design discussions and reviews
